## The concept of between queue and stack ##

### Queue ###
queses are a type of container adaptor; specifically designed to operate in a FIFO context (first-in first-out), where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extracted from the other.

### Stack ###
The std::stack class is a container adaptor that gives the programmer the functionality of stack; specifically designed to operate in a LIFO (last-in, first-out).
