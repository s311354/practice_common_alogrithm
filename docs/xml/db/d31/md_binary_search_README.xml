    <detaileddescription>
<para>For C program, a struct is a type consisting of a sequence of members whose storage is allocated in an ordered sequence. (as opposed to union, which is a type consisting of a sequence of members whose storage overlaps) Within a struct object, addresses of its elements increase in order in which the members were defined.</para>
<para>For C++ program, classes and structs are user-defined types, defined by class-specifier.</para>
