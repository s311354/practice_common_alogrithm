<title>The concept of Directed Graph</title>
<para>In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a directed graph is the graph that is made up a set of vertices connected by directed edges often called arcs, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network. In contrast, a graph where the edges are bidirectional is called an undirected graph.</para>
<para>In this simple program, I recapped and practiced how to implement the directed graph with C++. The code initially extracted from <ulink url="https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp/tree/master/graphs">Practice Directed Graph</ulink> and then reworked. The basic functions for the directed graph are a follows:<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>BFS (Breadth-first search): use queue and traverse all the connected nodes DFS (Depth-first search): use stack and traverse all the connected nodes</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph: check whether the graph contains a cycle or not</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Iterate in a Directed Graph: pointing to all of vertices in the directed graph</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>The corresponding result: <preformatted><computeroutput>DFS: 0 5 8 1 2 6 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
BFS: 0 1 5 2 8 4 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 </computeroutput></preformatted></para>
